# Machine Learning Tip-to-Toe

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Tip-to-Toe** series! 🎉 This repository is a companion to our YouTube series, where I guide you through the foundational concepts of machine learning from the ground up. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your skills, this series will help you build a solid understanding of essential tools and techniques in the field.

## 📚 Course Overview

In this course, we start with the basics of Python libraries essential for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. We'll then dive into both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, building a strong foundation for your journey into AI and data science.

### 🗂️ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders corresponding to each major topic covered in the course:

**1 NUMPY**: 
   - Introduction to NumPy, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
   - Learn how to create and manipulate arrays, perform vectorized operations, and understand the basics of linear algebra.

*More folders will be added as we progress through the course!*

### 🚀 Getting Started

To follow along with the course:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
